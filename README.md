# To do
* Make it an app: add a manifest, ServiceWorker
* Store checkins
* Schedule notifications
* Handle the 30-day renewal thing
    * Eventually make this configurable, too

# Two main use cases:
* Remind you when to do the thing
    * Configurable notification to help you with daily dose - default undismissable until acknowledged?
* Help figure out which pharmacy might have the thing

# Working on notifications locally
